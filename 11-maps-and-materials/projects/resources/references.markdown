### Books

[Physically Based Rendering, Third Edition: From Theory to Implementation 2016 by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, Greg Humphreys](http://www.pbr-book.org)

Programming Vertex and Pixel Shaders 2004 by Wolfgang Engel. This is an older book, but the section on Advanced Reflectance Algorithms is an approachable introduction to the various reflection models and distribution functions. He describes several of these in detail with many diagrams.
